# Snake Water Gun Game - Python 🐍💧🔫

This is a simple **command-line game** based on the classic *Snake-Water-Gun* concept, similar to *Rock-Paper-Scissors*.

## 🎮 Game Rules:
- Snake (0) drinks Water (1) → Snake wins
- Water (1) douses Gun (2) → Water wins
- Gun (2) kills Snake (0) → Gun wins

### Game Outcome Logic:
- If both the player and computer choose the same, it's a **draw**.
- If the computer's choice beats the player's, the computer **wins**.
- Otherwise, the **player wins**.

## 🧠 How It Works:
- You will play **5 rounds** against the computer.
- After each round, your **current score** is displayed.
- The computer makes its move randomly.
- Final score is shown after 5 rounds.
